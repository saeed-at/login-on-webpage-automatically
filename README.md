# Introduction
This code has been written for loggingÂ automatically in the AmirKabir University's internet site. Each time when you turn on your PC or laptop, you have to connect to the university's router, then you have to open your browser and go to `https://internet.aut.ac.ir` and fill in your username and password on this webpage as below, after logging in you will have access to the internet with your system.I wonder if I could write a code that logs in automatically with each startup in windows os and this code will do the trick.( it's easy to change to code for another login page, you just need to replace username, password and Enter elements with your website's elements by using inspect in the browser, if you got any problem email me:wink:)

The code will auto
